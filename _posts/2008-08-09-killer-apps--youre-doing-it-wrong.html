title: Killer Apps—You're Doing it Wrong

<p>During my morning journey through all that is new and noteworthy today, I ran across <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/144170">this article</a> about a "killer development tool" for Linux. The author of this article claims that the tool is "going to make ISVs and other programmers start to love developing for Linux."</p>
<p>I must admit that my interest was piqued. I've done at least a little bit of development on each of the major platforms (Windows, Mac, various flavors of Linux), and I must say that tool support had a big effect on the pleasantness of each experience. Furthermore, while I understand that many developers are quite comfortable with Linux, the lack of a "big neon sign" saying "start here" was a big turn off for me (contrast this with Visual Studio for Windows and XCode for MacOS, and you'll begin to understand what I mean).</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> this amazing tool? As it turns out, it's a package that helps developers find incompatibilities between their applications and various distributions of Linux.</p>
<p>That's a "killer" application? It's going to make me "love" developing for Linux?</p>
<p>Pardon my incredulity, but applying a band-aid over a problem that doesn't even exist (for the most part) on other platforms does not a killer application make. Nor will it make a person "love" developing for that platform. At the very most, one might say that it "makes the platform less painful" or "eases the burden associated with developing for the platform."</p>
<p>But "love?"</p>
<p>Not so much. I think I'll stick with Windows and MacOS for now, thankyouverymuch.</p>
<p>So today's lesson: if your "killer application" just eases the pain associated with a problem that doesn't exist in other environments, you're doing it wrong.</p>
