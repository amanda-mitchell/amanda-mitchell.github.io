<p>I've found <a href='http://dound.com/2009/04/git-forever-remove-files-or-folders-from-history/'>this page</a> useful on a few occasions, so I'm linking it from here so that I don't forget where it is.</p>

<p>The author demonstrates how to use git-filter-branch to completely remove files from a git repository. I haven't felt compelled to take all the steps that he does in order to get rid of the files, but it's an excellent reference for the command, nonetheless.</p>
