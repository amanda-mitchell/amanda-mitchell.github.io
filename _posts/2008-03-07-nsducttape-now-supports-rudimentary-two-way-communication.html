title: NSDuctTape now supports (rudimentary) two-way communication
layout: post

<p>This is just a quick note to let you know that NSDuctTape now supports communication in both directions (i.e.-you can now instantiate and manipulate Objective C objects from .NET). The support is still rudimentary, and it's not especially robust, but it's there, and it works. Currently, the new code is only available through Subversion, but I'll probably clean it up a bit and post a new download this weekend.</p>
