title: A Very…Amazon…Christmas

<p>You know that we’re in the Internet age when four out of five Christmas shoppers in my family use Amazon for shipping:<a href="/images/AmazonChristmas.jpg"><img title="Amazon boxes under a Christmas tree" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: block; border-left-width: 0px; float: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border-right-width: 0px" height="180" alt="Amazon boxes under a Christmas tree" src="/images/AmazonChristmas.jpg" width="240" border="0" /></a> </p>

<p>The family members who sent us stuff through Amazon didn’t opt for gift wrap (it’s a pretty expensive option), so we have to wait for Christmas day to even know who each package is <em>for</em>, let alone what it is or who ordered it. Perhaps we are seeing the formation of a new holiday tradition?</p>
